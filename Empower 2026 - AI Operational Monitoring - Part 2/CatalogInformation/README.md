# Empower 2026 - AI Operational Monitoring - Part 2

This package deploys several elements used throughout the *AI Operational Monitoring* session at Empower 2026. In this session, the features *Pattern Matching*, *Behavioral Anomaly Detection*, *Proactive Cap Detection* and *Relational Anomaly Detection* are showcased using these elements.

The elements will be deployed under the view *DataMiner Catalog* > *Empower 2026* > *AI Operational Monitoring*.

The same elements are also deployed by the package *Empower 2026 - AI Operational Monitoring - Part 1*. This package will only redeploy these elements if they do not already exist. In that case, it will deploy a version of the elements that reads in its history data faster.
If the elements are already deployed by the *Empower 2026 - AI Operational Monitoring - Part 2* package, it will let the elements load some additional data.
